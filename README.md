# Elmo
I have written the automation script using Python and Selenium on Windows.

Pre-requistes -
1. Install python. Add relevant environment variables
2. pip install selenium
3. Download chromedriver and add to PATH.

Steps -
Execute the Elmo.py.

Expected Output - 

 C:\Users\Python\Scripts>Elmo.py
 
 DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:57668/devtools/browser/b147e657-92e1-4638-8b43-8344e403ed0e
 
 The url of the webpage is as expected. The url is https://elmosoftware.com.au/solutions/core-hr/
 
 Key Benefits exists on page
 
 Seamless cloud-based payroll and HR solution exists on page
 
 Browse Jobs button exists
 
 Senior PHP Software Engineer exists on page.

Notes - 
Though the test asks to search for PHP Developer and type Sydney in the location text box, I have made changes due to changed UI. There are no openings for PHP developer, so I am searching for "PHP" instead. Also the Search location is a dropdown with Sydney location as a checkbox.
