 To convert the the automation tests completed in Test 1 into BDD scenarios, I have used Python, Selenium and Behave tools. 
 The files are organised as follows -
 1. Feature file - features\elmo.feature
 2. Step Definition file - features\steps\steps.py
 3. Environment file - features\environment.py
